In the former case, you're performing an explicit data type conversion, whereas in the latter, you're doing an implicit data type conversion.\n\n### Implicit Data Type Conversion\n\nImplicit conversion or _coercion_ is when data type conversion takes place either during compilation or during run time and is handled directly by Python for you. Let's see an example:","metadata":{},"id":"located-college","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"a_int = 1\nb_float = 1.0\nc_sum = a_int + b_float\nprint(c_sum)\nprint(type(c_sum))","metadata":{},"id":"attended-socket","cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["2.0\n","<class 'float'>\n"]}]},{"source":"**Tip**: you can use the `type()` function in Python to check the data type of an object.\n\nIn the example, an int value `a_int` was added to a float value `b_float`, and the result was automatically converted to a float value `c_sum` without you having to tell the compiler. This is the implicit data conversion. \n\nWhy was the float value not converted to integer instead? \n\nThis is due to a broader concept of type promotion in computer science. Simply put, this is a defense mechanism of the compiler that allows you to perform operations whenever possible by converting your data into a different supertype without the loss of information. \n\nThat means that the conversion from float to integer is not done because then the compiler will need to remove the fractional part leading to the loss of information.

You then need to put this value into the final display string and consequently need to convert the total to a string so as to concatenate it with the rest of the display message.\n\nHopefully, this example helps you to see the importance of data type conversions.

Lists and Tuples in Python are used to store collection of homogeneous items. The difference between tuples and list is that tuples are immutable, which means once defined you cannot delete, add or edit any values inside it.\n\nWhy would you convert lists to tuples? \n\nThat's because tuples are immutable data type and allows substantial optimization to the programs that you create.\n\nAnd why would you convert tuples to lists? \n\nMaybe you want to make changes to the initial tuple. Thus, you can convert them to lists and then make the change, then convert them back to tuples.\n\nYou can use the `tuple()` function to return a tuple version of the value passed to it and similarly the `list()` function to convert to a list:","metadata":{},"id":"fitted-semiconductor","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"a_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\nb_list = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nprint(tuple(b_list))\nprint(list(a_tuple))","metadata":{},"id":"authentic-floor","cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n"]}]},{"source":"You can also convert a string into a list or a tuple.","metadata":{},"id":"together-holmes","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"dessert = 'Cake'\n\n# Convert the characters in a string to individual items in a tuple\nprint(tuple(dessert)) \n\n# Convert a string into a list\ndessert_list = list(dessert) \ndessert_list.append('s')\nprint(dessert_list)   ","metadata":{},"id":"noted-bradford","cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["('C', 'a', 'k', 'e')\n","['C', 'a', 'k', 'e', 's']\n"]}]},{"source":"## Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Integers in Python\n\nThe number systems refer to the number of symbols or characters used to represent any numerical value. The number system that you typically use everyday is called _decimal_. In the decimal system, you use ten different symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. With these ten symbols, you can represent any quantity. Binary, hexadecimal, and octal refer to different number systems. \n\nWhen you run out of symbols, you go to the next digit placement. In the decimal system, to represent one higher than 9, you use 10 meaning one unit of ten and zero units of one. However, it is different in other number systems. For example, when you consider a binary system which only uses two symbols: 0 and 1, when you run out of symbols, you need to go to the next digit placement. So this is how you will count in binary: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101 and so on. \n\nLet's check out some of the number systems in more detail in the next sections.\n\n### Convert to Binary Number\n\nBinary integers are the number represented with base two. Which means in binary number system, there are only two symbols used to represent numbers: 0 and 1. When you count up from zero in binary, you run out of symbols more quickly: 0, 1, ???\n\nFurthermore there are no more symbols left. You do not go to the digit 2 because 2 doesn't exist in binary. Instead, you use a special combination of 1s and 0s. In a binary system, 1000 is equal to 8 in decimal. In binary, you use powers of two, which means 8 is basically: (1*(2^3)) + (0*(2^2)) + (0*(2^1)) + (0*(2^0))= 8. The position of the 1 and 0 defines the power to which 2 is to be raised to. \n\nLet's see this with a more complex example to make it clear:\n\n```\nBinary Number = 1001111 \nDecimal value = (1*(2^6)) + (0*(2^5)) + (0*(2^4)) + (1*(2^3)) + (1*(2^2)) + (1*(2^1)) + (1*(2^0)) \n              = 79\n```\n\nIn Python, you can simply use the `bin()` function to convert from a decimal value to its corresponding binary value. \n\nAnd similarly, the `int()` function to convert a binary to its decimal value. The `int()` function takes as second argument the base of the number to be converted, which is 2 incase of binary numbers.","metadata":{},"id":"excess-democracy","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"a = 79\n\n# Base 2(binary)\nbin_a = bin(a)\nprint(bin_a)\nprint(int(bin_a, 2)) #Base 2(binary)","metadata":{},"id":"blank-recording","cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0b1001111\n","79\n"]}]},{"source":"### Conversion to Octal\n\nOctal is another number system with less symbols to use than the conventional decimal number system. Octal is base eight, which means that eight symbols are used to represent all the quantities. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. After 7 is 10, since 8 doesn't exist.\n\nJust like you used powers of two in binary to determine the value of a number, you will use powers of 8 since this is base eight.\n\nIn a binary system, 10 is equal to 8 in octal. Let's break it down: (1*(8^1)) + (0*(8^0))= 8. \n\nA more complex example:\n\n```\nOctal Number = 117\nDecimal value = (1*(8^2)) + (1*(8^1)) + (7*(8^0))\n              = 79\n```\n\nIn Python, you can use the `oct()` function to convert from a decimal value to its corresponding octal value.

Unlike binary and octal, hexadecimal has six additional symbols that it used beyond the numbers found in decimal number system. \n\nBut what comes after 9? \n\nOnce additional symbols are needed beyond the normal numerical values, letters are to be used. So in hexadecimal, the total list of symbols used is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. \n\nUsing the same example as earlier:\n\n```\nHexadecimal Number = 4F\nDecimal value = (4*(16^1)) + (F*(16^0))\n              = 79\n```\n\nIn Python, you can use the `hex()` function to convert from a decimal value to its corresponding hexadecimal value, or the `int()` function with base 16 for the hexadecimal number system.","metadata":{},"id":"latter-frederick","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"a = 79\n\n# Base 16(hexadecimal)\nhex_a = hex(a)\nprint(hex_a)\nprint(int(hex_a, 16)) ","metadata":{},"id":"external-democrat","cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0x4f\n","79\n"]}]},{"source":"## You Made It!\n\nCongrats!
