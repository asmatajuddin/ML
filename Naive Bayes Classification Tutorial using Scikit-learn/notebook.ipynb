Or As a loan manager, you want to identify which loan applicants are safe or risky? As a healthcare analyst, you want to predict which patients can suffer from diabetes disease. All the examples have the same kind of problem to classify reviews, loan applicants, and patients.\n\nNaive Bayes is the most straightforward and fast classification algorithm, which is suitable for a large chunk of data.  Naive Bayes classifier is successfully used in various applications such as spam filtering, text classification, sentiment analysis, and recommender systems. It uses Bayes theorem of probability for prediction of unknown class.\n\nIn this tutorial, you are going to learn about all of the following:\n\n- Classification Workflow\n- What is Naive Bayes classifier?\n- How Naive Bayes classifier works?\n- Classifier building in Scikit-learn\n- Zero Probability Problem\n- It's advantages and disadvantages\n\n![naive bayes ](graphics/figure1.jpeg)\n\n## Classification Workflow\n\nWhenever you perform classification, the first step is to understand the problem and identify potential features and label. Features are those characteristics or attributes which affect the results of the label. For example, in the case of a loan distribution, bank manager's identify customer’s occupation, income, age, location, previous loan history, transaction history, and credit score. These characteristics are known as features which help the model classify customers.\n\nThe classification has two phases, a learning phase, and the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, classifier trains its model on a given dataset and in the evaluation phase, it tests the classifier performance. Performance is evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as accuracy, error, precision, and recall.\n\n![classification workflow](graphics/figure2.png)\n\n## What is Naive Bayes Classifier?\n\nNaive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Naive Bayes classifier is a fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.\n\nNaive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. For example, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as naive. This assumption is called class conditional independence.\n\n$$ P(h|D) = \\frac{P(D|h) P(h)}{P(D)} $$\n\n- $P(h)$ : the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data). This is known as the prior probability of h.\n- $P(D)$ : the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis). This is known as the prior probability.\n- $P(h|D)$ : the probability of hypothesis h given the data D. This is known as posterior probability.\n- $P(D|h)$ : the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true. This is known as posterior probability.\n\n## How Naive Bayes classifier works?\n\nLet’s understand the working of Naive Bayes through an example. Given an example of weather conditions and Playing sports. You need to calculate the probability of Playing sports. Now, you need to classify whether Play ers will Play  or not, based on the weather condition.\n\n### First Approach (In case of a single feature)\n\nNaive Bayes classifier calculates the probability of an event in the following steps:\n\n- Step 1: Calculate the prior probability for given class labels\n- Step 2: Find Likelihood probability with each attribute for each class\n- Step 3: Put these values in Bayes Formula and calculate the posterior probability.\n- Step 4: See which class has a higher probability, given the input belongs to the higher probability class.\n\nFor simplifying prior and posterior probability calculation you can use the two tables frequency and likelihood tables. Both of these tables will help you to calculate the prior and posterior probability. The Frequency table contains the occurrence of labels for all features. There are two likelihood tables. Likelihood Table 1 is showing prior probabilities of labels and Likelihood Table 2 is showing the posterior probability.\n\n![likelihood tables](graphics/figure3.png)\n\nNow suppose you want to calculate the probability of Playing when the weather is overcast.\n\n**Probability of Playing:**\n\n$$ \n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(Yes | Overcast)} = \\frac{\\text{P(Overcast | Yes) } \\text{P(Yes)}}{\\text{P (Overcast)}} \\tag 1\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n1. Calculate Prior Probabilities:\n    $\\text{P(Overcast)} = 4/14 = 0.29$\n    $\\text{P(Yes)}= 9/14 = 0.64$\n\n2. Calculate Posterior Probabilities:\n\n    $\\text{P(Overcast |Yes)} = 4/9 = 0.44$\n\n\n3. Put Prior and Posterior probabilities in equation (1)\n\n    $\\text{P(Yes | Overcast)} = 0.44 - 0.64 / 0.29 = 0.98 \\text{(Higher)}$\n\nSimilarly, you can calculate the probability of not Playing:","metadata":{},"id":"ed7f09fb","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**Probability of not Playing:**\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(No | Overcast)} = \\frac{{\\text{P(Overcast | No)} \\text{P(No)}}}{\\text{P(Overcast)}} \\tag 2\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n\n1. Calculate Prior Probabilities:\n\n    $\\text{P(Overcast)} = 4/14 = 0.29$\n\n    $\\text{P(No)}= 5/14 = 0.36$\n\n\n2. Calculate Posterior Probabilities:\n\n    $\\text{P(Overcast |No)} = 0/9 = 0$\n\n\n3. Put Prior and Posterior probabilities in equation (2)\n\n    $\\text{P (No | Overcast)} = 0 - 0.36 / 0.29 = 0$\n\n\n*The probability of a 'Yes' class is higher. So you can determine here if the weather is overcast than Players will Play  the sport.*\n\n### Second Approach (In case of multiple features)\n\n![](graphics/figure4.jpeg)\n\nNow suppose you want to calculate the probability of Playing when the weather is overcast, and the temperature is mild.\n\n**Probability of Playing:**\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(Yes | Overcast, Mild)} = \\text{P(Overcast, Mild | Yes)} * \\text{P(Yes)}  \\tag 1\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(Overcast, Mild | Yes)} = \\text{P(Overcast |Yes)} *\\text{P(Mild |Yes)} \\tag 2\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n1. Calculate Prior Probabilities:\n    $\\text{P(Yes)}= 9/14 = 0.64$\n\n2. Calculate Posterior Probabilities:\n    $\\text{P(Overcast | Yes}) = 4/9 = 0.44$\n    $\\text{P(Mild | Yes)} = 4/9 = 0.44$\n\n3. Put Posterior probabilities in equation (2)\n    $\\text{P(Overcast, Mild | Yes)} = 0.44 - 0.44 = 0.1936 \\text{(Higher)}$\n\n4. Put Prior and Posterior probabilities in equation (1)\n    $\\text{P(Yes | Overcast, Mild)} = 0.1936*0.64 = 0.124$\n\nSimilarly, you can calculate the probability of not Playing:\n\n**Probability of not Playing:**\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(No | Overcast, Mild)} = \\text{P(Overcast, Mild | No)} * \\text{P(No)} \\tag 3\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{P(Overcast, Mild | No)} = \\text{P(Overcast | No)} * \\text{P(Mild | No)} \\tag 4\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n\n1. Calculate Prior Probabilities:\n    $\\text{P(No)}= 5/14 = 0.36$\n\n2. Calculate Posterior Probabilities:\n    $\\text{P(Overcast | No)} = 0/9 = 0$\n    $\\text{P(Mild | No)}=2/5=0.4$\n\n3. Put posterior probabilities in equation (4)\n    $\\text{P(Overcast, Mild | No)} = 0 - 0.4= 0$\n\n4. Put prior and posterior probabilities in equation (3)\n    $\\text{P(No | Overcast, Mild)} = 0*0.36=0$\n\n*The probability of a 'Yes' class is higher. So you can say here that if the weather is overcast than Play ers will Play  the sport.*","metadata":{},"id":"f2c1c159","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Classifier Building in Scikit-learn\n\n### Naive Bayes Classifier\n\n#### Defining Dataset\n\nIn this example, you can use the dummy dataset with three columns: weather, temperature, and Play .

This problem is known as Zero Probability because the occurrence of the particular class is zero.\n\nThe solution for such an issue is the Laplacian correction or Laplace Transformation. Laplacian correction is one of the smoothing techniques. Here, you can assume that the dataset is large enough that adding one row of each class will not make a difference in the estimated probability. This will overcome the issue of probability values to zero.\n\nFor Example:\nSuppose that for the class loan risky, there are 1000 training tuples in the database. In this database, income column has 0 tuples for low income, 990 tuples for medium income, and 10 tuples for high income. The probabilities of these events, without the Laplacian correction, are 0, 0.990 (from 990/1000), and 0.010 (from 10/1000)\n\nNow, apply Laplacian correction on the given dataset.\nLet's add 1 more tuple for each income-value pair. The probabilities of these events:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1003} = 0.001, \\frac{991}{1003} = 0.988, \\text{and } \\frac{11}{1003} = 0.011$$\n\n## Advantages\n\n- It is not only a simple approach but also a fast and accurate method for prediction.\n- Naive Bayes has very low computation cost.\n- It can efficiently work on a large dataset.\n- It performs well in case of discrete response variable compared to the continuous variable.\n- It can be used with multiple class prediction problems.\n- It also performs well in the case of text analytics problems.\n- When the assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compared to other models like logistic regression.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- The assumption of independent features. In practice, it is almost impossible that model will get a set of predictors which are entirely independent.\n- If there is no training tuple of a particular class, this causes zero posterior probability. In this case, the model is unable to make predictions. This problem is known as Zero Probability/Frequency Problem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations, you have made it to the end of this tutorial!\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned about Naïve Bayes algorithm, it's working, Naive Bayes assumption, issues, implementation, advantages, and disadvantages.
