It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.\n\nDimensions are nothing but features that represent the data. For example, A 28 X 28 image has 784 picture elements (pixels) that are the dimensions or features which together represent that image.\n\nOne important thing to note about PCA is that it is an **Unsupervised** dimensionality reduction technique, you can cluster the similar data points based on the feature correlation between them without any supervision (or labels), and you will learn how to achieve this practically using Python in later sections of this tutorial!\n\nAccording to *Wikipedia*, PCA is a **statistical** procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n\n**Note**: Features, Dimensions, and Variables are all referring to the same thing. You will find them being used interchangeably.\n\n#### But where can you apply PCA?\n\n- **Data Visualization**: When working on any data related problem, the challenge in today's world is the sheer volume of data, and the variables/features that define that data. To solve a problem where data is the key, you need extensive data exploration like finding out how the variables are correlated or understanding the distribution of a few variables. Considering that there are a large number of variables or dimensions along which the data is distributed, visualization can be a challenge and almost impossible.\n\n    Hence, PCA can do that for you since it projects the data into a lower dimension, thereby allowing you to visualize the data in a 2D or 3D space with a naked eye.\n\n- **Speeding Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm**: Since PCA's main idea is dimensionality reduction, you can leverage that to speed up your machine learning algorithm's training and testing time considering your data has a lot of features, and the ML algorithm's learning is too slow.\n\nAt an abstract level,  you take a dataset having many features, and you simplify that dataset by selecting a few ``Principal Components`` from original features.\n\n#### What is a Principal Component?\n\nPrincipal components are the key to PCA; they represent what's underneath the hood of your data. In a layman term, when the data is projected into a lower dimension (assume three dimensions) from a higher space, the three dimensions are nothing but the three Principal Components that captures (or holds) most of the variance (information) of your data.\n\nPrincipal components have both direction and magnitude. The direction represents across which *principal axes* the data is mostly spread out or has most variance and the magnitude signifies the amount of variance that Principal Component captures of the data when projected onto that axis. The principal components are a straight line, and the first principal component holds the most variance in the data. Each subsequent principal component is orthogonal to the last and has a lesser variance. In this way, given a set of <i>x</i> correlated variables over <i>y</i> samples you achieve a set of <i>u</i> uncorrelated principal components over the same <i>y</i> samples.\n\nThe reason you achieve uncorrelated principal components from the original features is that the correlated features contribute to the same principal component, thereby reducing the original data features into uncorrelated principal components; each representing a different set of correlated features with different amounts of variation.\n\nEach principal component represents a percentage of total variation captured from the data.\n\nIn today's tutorial, you will mainly apply PCA on the two use-cases:\n- ``Data Visualization``\n- ``Speeding ML algorithm``\n\nTo accomplish the above two tasks, you will use two famous Breast Cancer (numerical) and CIFAR - 10 (image) dataset.\n\n## Understanding the Data\n\nBefore you go ahead and load the data, it's good to understand and look at the data that you will be working with!\n\n### Breast Cancer\n\nThe Breast Cancer data set is a real-valued multivariate data that consists of two classes, where each class signifies whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The two categories are: malignant and benign.\n\nThe malignant class has 212 samples, whereas the benign class has 357 samples.\n\nIt has 30 features shared across all classes: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, fractal dimension, etc.\n\nYou can download the breast cancer dataset from <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)\">here</a>, or rather an easy way is by loading it with the help of the ``sklearn`` library.\n\n### CIFAR - 10\n\nThe CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset consists of 60000 images each of 32x32x3 color images having ten classes, with 6000 images per category.\n\nThe dataset consists of 50000 training images and 10000 test images.\n\nThe classes in the dataset are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.","metadata":{},"id":"eff3eda2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"You can download the CIFAR dataset from <a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html\">here</a>, or you can also load it on the fly with the help of a deep learning library like ``Keras``.\n\n## Data Exploration\n\nNow you will be loading and analyzing the ``Breast Cancer`` and ``CIFAR-10`` datasets.

As you learned earlier that PCA projects turn high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional principal component, now is the time to visualize that with the help of Python!\n\n### Visualizing the Breast Cancer data\n\n- You start by <b>``Standardizing``</b> the data since PCA's output is influenced based on the scale of the features of the data.\n- It is a common practice to normalize your data before feeding it to any machine learning algorithm.\n\n- To apply normalization, you will import ``StandardScaler`` module from the sklearn library and select only the features from the ``breast_dataset`` you created in the Data Exploration step. Once you have the features, you will then apply scaling by doing ``fit_transform`` on the feature data.\n\n- While applying StandardScaler, each feature of your data should be normally distributed such that it will scale the distribution to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"af0a74ed","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nx = breast_dataset.loc[:, features].values\nx = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x) # normalizing the features","metadata":{},"id":"fdfe1f1e","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"x.shape","metadata":{},"id":"f2b9b14e","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Let's check whether the normalized data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n","metadata":{},"id":"1289aa70","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"np.mean(x),np.std(x)","metadata":{},"id":"426698fe","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Let's convert the normalized features into a tabular format with the help of DataFrame.\n","metadata":{},"id":"f64495bf","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"feat_cols = ['feature' + str(i) for i in range(x.shape[1])]","metadata":{},"id":"8e8003d6","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"normalised_breast = pd.DataFrame(x,columns=feat_cols)","metadata":{},"id":"d2e41d94","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"normalised_breast.tail()","metadata":{},"id":"962f925c","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"- Now comes the critical part, the next few lines of code will be projecting the thirty-dimensional Breast Cancer data to two-dimensional <b>``principal components``</b>.\n\n- You will use the sklearn library to import the ``PCA`` module, and in the PCA method, you will pass the number of components (n_components=2) and finally call fit_transform on the aggregate data.
