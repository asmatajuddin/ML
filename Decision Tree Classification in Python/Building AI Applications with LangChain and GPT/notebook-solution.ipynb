This is easy to achieve in LangChain thanks to [Document Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders.html). In our case, we're targeting a \"Read the docs\" documentation, for which there is a loader [`ReadTheDocsLoader`](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/readthedocs_documentation.html).\nIn the folder `rtdocs`, you'll find all the HTML files from the LangChain documentation (https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html). \n\n<details>\n    <summary>How did we obtain the data</summary>\n<br/><p>These file were downloaded by executing this linux command:</p>\n<pre>\nwget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/\n</pre>\n<p>We urge you **NOT** to execute this during the live training, as it will scan and download the full langchain doc site (~1000 files).

At the end of this task, we'll have a variable `raw_documents` containing a list of `Document`: one `Document` per HTML file. \n\nNote that in this step we won't actually load the documents into a database, we're simply loading the documents in a list.\n\n### Instructions\n1. import `ReadTheDocsLoader` from `langchain.document_loaders`\n2.

Consider the following improvements:\n- **Clean up the documents**.  \n  Each document currently starts with useless text, and ends with a copyright notice. These texts do not provide value in our case and should be removed before embedding. Try to make an additional step after loading the `raw_documents`. In this step, iterate over all documents and find a way to remove unnecessary text.\n- **Add streaming to the LLM**.  \n  Instead of waiting for the full response, you can get a better experience by streaming the LLM response (much like the ChatGPT web interface). Look at the `playground.ipynb` notebook for an example, or check the [docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/chat/examples/streaming.html).\n- **Return sources to the user**.  \n  Getting a response is nice, but linking to the relevant docs is even better. There are a few techniques to return the source documents to the user. The simplest is to print the metadata of all the `context_docs` returned by the semantic search. In this example, you could use `doc.metadata[\"source\"]` to create a link to the langchain docs. A more advanced technique can be found [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_qa_with_sources.html).\n- **Add memory support to the chain**.  \n  You can pass a `memory` argument to the `LLMChain`. Since we have multiple input variables, make sure to specify which one the memory should use: `ConversationBufferMemory(input_key=\"question\")`. You will also need to rerite the question before searching for documents, as the full context will not always be contained in the user input. You can find a working example in `going-further/adding-memory.ipynb`\n\n<br />\n\n### Useful links\n- Learn more about embeddings: https://txt.cohere.com/sentence-word-embeddings/\n- Learn more about vector databases: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/\n","metadata":{},"id":"f633b2cc-dbdf-40f2-9561-a1227d8b8a7d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## LangChain caveats\n\nWhile LangChain is a great tool to discover concepts and techniques, it falls short to help you deliver a production-ready application:\n- Documentation is lacking. The documentation is not very complete and mostly made of examples, it lacks explanations and proper descriptions. To fully discover how a given module is working, you will need to peek in the code ([here on GitHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain))\n- Too many abstractions. LangChain brings a lot of classes, some would argue too many. A `PromptTemplate` for example is pretty much the equivalent of a simple python f-string.\n- Very opinionated. As soon as you want to customize a chain (or agent), you will find that it's not always the smost simple thing. Many end-up re-implementing LangChain classes or functions to suit their needs better.\n\nLangChain is a great starting point and will let you write compelling demos very quickly.
